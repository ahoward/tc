- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Notes

**Passed all quality checks** âœ“

The specification is complete and ready for planning phase (`/speckit.plan`).

### Strengths:
- Clear prioritization of user stories (P1-P3) with independent testability
- Comprehensive edge case coverage including terminal handling
- Well-defined success criteria that are measurable and technology-agnostic
- Proper scope boundaries with explicit "Out of Scope" section
- TTY detection and non-TTY fallback requirements clearly specified
- JSONL log format requirements enable streamability and filterability

### Ready for Next Phase:
All checklist items pass. No clarifications needed. Spec is ready for `/speckit.plan`.
