# Feature Specification: TC - Language-Agnostic Testing Framework

**Feature Branch**: `001-design-a-testing`
**Created**: 2025-10-11
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "design a testing (TDD) framework that is language agnostic.  the point is to develop a testing suite that applies to an applicaiton that is langage agnostic.  this is in to facilitate 'spec driven development, ala 'spec-kit', from GH (https://github.com/github/spec-kit).  our aim, is support language agnostisism.  meaning, if we specs, and a langage independent testing framework.  we should be able to port langauges.  for this system, i suggest (but do not demand) the following concepts 1. test suites, are directorys.  each test suite has a test runner (a script, binary, etc) that conforms to a uniform interface.  namely, that it will run as a binary/script.  expected inputs will be compare with expected outputs, both of which will be stored as prety json files, parallel/nested alongside each test suite.  the test directory should support a 'hierarchical' setup, taht is to say ./tc/user/login/tc, where 'user/login' is the logical feature being tested, and all materials (README.md, ./data/scenario-name/i.json (input) and ./data/scenario-name/o.json (output)) are 'bundled' in a subdirectory alongside the 'feature' or test suite.  do not be critically attached to this design, but, inform your deisgn from these ideas.   tests suites should be deisgned to be prepared, run singly, in bunches, or all.  parallel execution is a must.  for speed.  consider and output mode that drops results and logs back into the test directories themselves, with high level reporting from the tc test suite runner.   favor jsonl and simple line oriencted concepts.  data in stdout, infor/logging on stderr.  tc stands for 'test case' and should riff on the magnum pi character of the same name.  with his helicopter."

Additional context: "one aspect i forget to mention is that easy of insatllation, and portability, are key.  consider using an approach to spec-kit, which drops /slash commans in for an ai...."

## Clarifications

### Session 2025-10-11

- Q: Test output comparison strategy - how should the framework handle comparison? → A: Semantic JSON comparison (order-independent for objects) by default, whitespace normalization if configured, with fuzzy matching as optional - prioritize simplicity
- Q: Test timeout handling - when a test runner hangs or runs indefinitely, what timeout behavior should apply? → A: Configurable per-suite with global default
- Q: Parallel execution concurrency control - how should the framework control the degree of parallelism? → A: Auto-detect CPU cores with override option
- Q: Test suite directory structure requirements - what are the minimum required files/structure for a valid test suite? → A: Test runner + at least one input/output scenario data pair
- Q: Result file persistence strategy - how should the framework handle result file naming and retention? → A: Single result file overwritten each run, not committed to version control to avoid conflicts

## User Scenarios & Testing

### User Story 1 - Run Single Test Suite Independently (Priority: P1)

A developer working on a specific feature needs to verify that feature's behavior without running the entire test suite. They should be able to execute tests for just that feature and receive immediate, clear feedback about success or failure.

**Why this priority**: Core value proposition - enables rapid feedback during development and is the atomic unit of the testing framework. All other functionality builds on this.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by creating one test suite directory with input/output data files, running the test, and verifying correct pass/fail reporting based on output comparison.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a test suite directory exists with input and expected output files, **When** a developer runs the test suite, **Then** the system executes the test and reports whether actual output matches expected output
2. **Given** a test suite completes execution, **When** the developer views results, **Then** they see clear pass/fail status and can identify any differences between expected and actual outputs
3. **Given** a test suite contains multiple test scenarios, **When** the developer runs the suite, **Then** each scenario is executed and results are aggregated into a suite-level summary

---

### User Story 2 - Install and Use Framework Without Dependencies (Priority: P2)

A new team member or CI/CD system needs to start using the testing framework immediately without complex installation procedures, dependency management, or configuration. The framework should work out-of-the-box with minimal setup.

**Why this priority**: Critical for adoption and portability. If teams can't easily install and use the framework, they won't adopt it. Essential for CI/CD integration.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by attempting installation on a clean system, running a test suite without additional configuration, and verifying successful execution without requiring external dependencies.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a clean system without the framework, **When** a user follows installation steps, **Then** the framework is ready to use in under 2 minutes
2. **Given** the framework is installed, **When** a user runs their first test, **Then** no additional dependencies or configuration are required
3. **Given** a team uses different operating systems, **When** they install the framework, **Then** it works consistently across all platforms

---

### User Story 3 - Organize Tests Hierarchically by Feature (Priority: P3)

Development teams need to organize tests to mirror their application's feature structure, making it easy to locate and maintain tests as the application evolves. Tests for related features should be grouped together logically.

**Why this priority**: Essential for maintainability and scalability, but requires the P1 and P2 functionality to be valuable. Enables teams to organize tests as complexity grows.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by creating nested test suite directories (e.g., feature/subfeature/test-suite), running tests at different hierarchy levels, and verifying that test organization doesn't affect execution correctness.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** test suites are organized in nested directories by feature, **When** a developer browses the test directory structure, **Then** they can intuitively locate tests for any specific feature
2. **Given** hierarchically organized test suites, **When** a developer runs tests from any level in the hierarchy, **Then** the system executes all tests within that subtree
3. **Given** test results from a hierarchical structure, **When** viewing the summary report, **Then** results are aggregated and presented at each hierarchy level

---

### User Story 4 - Execute Tests in Parallel (Priority: P4)

Teams with large test suites need to minimize total execution time by running independent tests concurrently. This is especially critical for continuous integration pipelines where fast feedback is essential.

**Why this priority**: Performance optimization that provides significant value for large test suites, but requires P1-P3 to be in place. Not critical for initial adoption with small test suites.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by creating multiple independent test suites, running them in parallel, measuring total execution time compared to sequential execution, and verifying all results are correctly captured.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** multiple independent test suites exist, **When** tests are executed in parallel mode, **Then** total execution time is significantly reduced compared to sequential execution
2. **Given** parallel test execution is running, **When** multiple tests complete simultaneously, **Then** all test results are correctly captured without conflicts or data loss
3. **Given** a parallel test run completes, **When** viewing the results, **Then** the summary accurately reflects outcomes from all parallel executions

---

### User Story 5 - Run Selective Test Groups (Priority: P5)

Developers need to run specific subsets of tests (e.g., all authentication tests, all API tests) without running the entire suite. This enables focused testing during development and debugging.

**Why this priority**: Developer convenience feature that improves workflow efficiency. Valuable but not required for basic framework functionality.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by creating test suites with different categorizations, specifying a subset to run, and verifying only the requested tests execute while others are skipped.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a collection of test suites organized by feature, **When** a developer specifies a subset to run, **Then** only tests matching that subset are executed
2. **Given** a selective test run completes, **When** viewing results, **Then** the report clearly indicates which tests were included and which were excluded from the run

---

### User Story 6 - Port Application to New Language While Reusing Tests (Priority: P6)

A team decides to rewrite their application in a different programming language. They should be able to reuse their existing test suite to verify the new implementation produces identical behavior to the original.

**Why this priority**: Ultimate validation of the language-agnostic approach. Demonstrates the framework's core value proposition but is less frequently used than daily testing scenarios.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by implementing the same feature in two different languages, using identical test suite definitions, and verifying both implementations pass the same tests.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** an existing test suite for an application feature, **When** the same feature is reimplemented in a different language, **Then** the same test suite can validate both implementations without modification
2. **Given** test suites are shared across implementations in different languages, **When** comparing test results, **Then** both implementations can be verified to produce identical outputs for identical inputs

---

### User Story 7 - Capture Test Results and Logs Persistently (Priority: P7)

QA teams and CI/CD systems need to preserve detailed test results and logs for historical analysis, debugging failed test runs, and compliance documentation.

**Why this priority**: Important for production use and CI/CD integration, but not required for initial developer adoption during feature development.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by running test suites, verifying result files are written to designated locations, and confirming logs contain sufficient detail for debugging failures.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** test suites execute, **When** tests complete, **Then** detailed results and logs are written to a standard result file within the test directory structure
2. **Given** a test fails, **When** a developer examines the logged output, **Then** they have sufficient information to diagnose the failure without re-running the test
3. **Given** a test runs multiple times, **When** viewing the result file, **Then** it contains the most recent execution results (previous results are overwritten)

---

### Edge Cases

- What happens when a test suite runner executable doesn't exist or isn't executable?
- How does the system handle test suites with missing input or expected output files?
- What happens when test execution exceeds the configured timeout? (System terminates test runner process and reports timeout failure)
- How are tests handled when expected output format doesn't match actual output format (e.g., different JSON structure)?
- What happens when parallel test execution encounters resource contention (file locks, port conflicts)?
- How does the system handle test suites with circular directory structures or symbolic links?
- What happens when a test suite produces output to both stdout and stderr but only stdout is compared?
- How are test results aggregated when the same test suite is run multiple times concurrently?
- What happens when test data files contain invalid JSON or unparseable content?
- How does the system behave when installed on systems with different path separators or file system constraints?
- What happens when users attempt to run tests without proper file permissions?

## Assumptions

- Test runners are responsible for executing application logic and producing output; the framework only orchestrates execution and compares results
- Test data files use JSON format by default for structured input/output representation
- Test suite runners produce deterministic output for given inputs (no random behavior that would cause false failures)
- Test execution environment has sufficient resources (CPU, memory, disk) to support parallel execution
- File system supports standard directory operations and hierarchical organization
- Test scenarios within a suite are independent and can be run in any order
- Standard input/output streams are available for communication between framework and test runners
- Exit codes from test runners indicate execution success/failure (0 = success, non-zero = failure)
- Test suite directories contain all necessary files and dependencies for execution (self-contained)
- Users have basic command-line familiarity for running tests and interpreting results
- Target systems have standard POSIX-compatible shells or command interpreters available
- Line-oriented output formats (JSONL, newline-delimited) are acceptable for result reporting
