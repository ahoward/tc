# Specification Quality Checklist: TC Source Layout Refactoring

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-10-12
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Notes

**Passed all quality checks**:
- Spec is technology-agnostic (refactoring described without bash/shell specifics)
- All requirements are testable (e.g., "commands produce identical outputs")
- Success criteria are measurable (e.g., "locate entry point in under 10 seconds")
- Three prioritized user stories with clear acceptance scenarios
- Edge cases identified (5 scenarios)
- Assumptions documented (7 items)
- Out of scope clearly defined (10 exclusions)
- No clarifications needed - refactoring is well-defined

**Ready for**: `/speckit.plan`
