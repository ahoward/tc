# Tasks: Multi-Language AI Prompt System with Unified Testing

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/006-i-want-to/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md, spec.md, research.md, data-model.md, contracts/, quickstart.md

**Tests**: Tests included - tc test suite is core to validating the pattern

**Organization**: Tasks grouped by user story (US1-US4) to enable independent implementation and testing

## Format: `[ID] [P?] [Story] Description`
- **[P]**: Can run in parallel (different files, no dependencies)
- **[Story]**: Which user story this task belongs to (US1, US2, US3, US4, SHARED)
- Include exact file paths in descriptions

## Path Conventions
Multiple standalone projects: `projects/{ruby,go,rust,javascript,python}/`
Shared test suite: `tests/multi-lang-dao/`

---

## Phase 1: Setup (Shared Infrastructure)

**‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL**: No language-specific work can begin until this phase is complete

## Dependencies & Execution Order

### Phase Dependencies

- **Setup (Phase 1)**: No dependencies - can start immediately
- **Foundational (Phase 2)**: Depends on Setup - BLOCKS all language implementations
- **User Stories (Phase 3-6)**: All depend on Foundational phase completion
  - User stories can proceed in parallel (different languages) OR sequentially by priority
- **Polish (Phase 7)**: Depends on all user stories complete

### User Story Dependencies

- **User Story 1 (P1)**: Can start after Foundational - No dependencies on other stories
- **User Story 2 (P2)**: Can start after Foundational - Extends US1 but independently testable
- **User Story 3 (P3)**: Requires US1 + US2 complete (needs operations to test)
- **User Story 4 (P4)**: Can start after Foundational - Independent of US1-3 (new operations)

### Within Each User Story

- Shared test data before language implementations
- Language implementations can proceed in parallel (different teams)
- Within a language: ResultStore ‚Üí DAO ‚Üí Operations ‚Üí Integration ‚Üí Test
- Ruby first (showcase clean code), then Go, Python, JavaScript, Rust

### Parallel Opportunities

**Phase 1 (Setup)**: All 6 tasks (T001-T006) can run in parallel

**Phase 2 (Foundational)**: Tasks T008-T012 (test data creation) can run in parallel

**Phase 3 (US1)**:
- Ruby, Go, Python, JavaScript, Rust implementations can run in parallel (T014-T050)
- Within each language: ResultStore + DAO skeleton (2 tasks) can run in parallel
- Tests per language can run in parallel

**Phase 4 (US2)**: All /result/poll handler implementations (T051-T055) can run in parallel, then routing integration (T056-T060) in parallel, then tests (T061-T065) in parallel

**Phase 5 (US3)**: Documentation tasks can run in parallel

**Phase 6 (US4)**: All template operation implementations can run in parallel per language

**Phase 7 (Polish)**: README updates (T095-T099) can run in parallel

---

## Parallel Example: User Story 1 (Ruby Implementation)

```bash
# Launch in parallel (different files):
Task: "Create ResultStore class in projects/ruby/lib/result_store.rb"
Task: "Create DAO class skeleton in projects/ruby/lib/dao.rb"

# Sequential (same file):
Task: "Implement /prompt/generate handler in projects/ruby/lib/operations.rb"
Task: "Integrate /prompt/generate with DAO routing in projects/ruby/lib/dao.rb"
```

---

## Implementation Strategy

### MVP First (User Story 1 Only - Single Language)

1. Complete Phase 1: Setup (T001-T006)
2. Complete Phase 2: Foundational (T007-T012) ‚Üê CRITICAL
3. Complete Phase 3: User Story 1 **Ruby only** (T014-T020)
4. **STOP and VALIDATE**: Test Ruby implementation with tc suite
5. Demo working MVP: single language, single operation, validates pattern

### Incremental Delivery (Priority Order)

1. MVP: Ruby + /prompt/generate (US1 partial)
2. Add: Go + Python + JavaScript + Rust for /prompt/generate (US1 complete)
3. Add: /result/poll across all languages (US2 complete)
4. Validate: Shared test suite works (US3 complete)
5. Add: Template operations across all languages (US4 complete)

### Parallel Team Strategy

With 5 developers after Foundational phase completes:

1. **Developer 1**: Ruby implementation (all phases)
2. **Developer 2**: Go implementation (all phases)
3. **Developer 3**: Python implementation (all phases) üêç
4. **Developer 4**: JavaScript implementation (all phases)
5. **Developer 5**: Rust implementation (all phases) ü¶Ä

Each developer delivers independently testable implementation, then integrates via shared tc test suite.

---

## Notes

- **KISS**: Minimal implementations (200-300 LOC each), standard libraries
- **Ruby Priority**: Make it really clean - showcase idiomatic code
- **Python Theming**: Playful üêç comments throughout
- **tc Test Suite**: Core validation - must pass for all languages
- **[P] tasks**: Different files OR different languages = parallel
- **Independent Stories**: Each user story delivers value independently
- **Checkpoints**: Validate after each phase before proceeding
- **Commit frequency**: After each task or logical group (per language)

**Total Tasks**: 104
**MVP Tasks** (Ruby + /prompt/generate): 13 (T001-T006, T007-T013, T014-T020)
**Per Language**: ~20-25 tasks
**Parallel Potential**: High - 5 independent language implementations

---

**Ready for `/speckit.implement`**: Yes - all tasks are specific, actionable, with exact file paths
