# Requirements Quality Checklist: Test Generation

**Purpose**: Validate the quality and completeness of test generation requirements for developers implementing `/tc.specify`
**Created**: 2025-10-18
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)
**Focus**: Test Generation Requirements (FR-001 through FR-005, User Story 1)
**Depth**: Lightweight - critical gaps and ambiguities for implementation
**Audience**: Developers implementing test generation logic

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] CHK001 - Are the spec parsing requirements defined (how to extract user stories from markdown)? [Gap] → ✅ Resolved in research.md Decision 1 (grep/sed patterns)
- [x] CHK002 - Are the acceptance criteria extraction requirements specified (format, delimiters, structure)? [Gap] → ✅ Resolved in research.md Decision 1 (Given/When/Then parsing)
- [x] CHK003 - Are input.json generation requirements defined for each acceptance scenario type? [Completeness, Spec §FR-003] → ✅ Addressed in contracts/tc-kit-specify.md
- [x] CHK004 - Are expected.json generation requirements specified for technology-agnostic outputs? [Completeness, Spec §FR-003] → ✅ Addressed in contracts/tc-kit-specify.md, research.md Decision 2
- [x] CHK005 - Are run script template requirements defined (language, permissions, error handling)? [Gap, Spec §FR-005] → ✅ Resolved in research.md Decision 4 (POSIX template)
- [x] CHK006 - Are file naming convention requirements specified for generated test directories? [Gap, Clarification §2025-10-18] → ✅ Resolved in research.md Decision 3 (kebab-case, zero-pad)

## Requirement Clarity

- [x] CHK007 - Is "tc-compatible test suite" explicitly defined with required file structure? [Clarity, Spec §FR-001] → ✅ Addressed in contracts/tc-kit-specify.md, data-model.md Entity 4
- [x] CHK008 - Is "one test scenario per acceptance criteria" clarified for scenarios with multiple Given/When/Then clauses? [Ambiguity, Spec §FR-002] → ✅ Addressed in contracts/tc-kit-specify.md (one test per scenario)
- [x] CHK009 - Are the default technology-agnostic patterns exhaustively listed with examples? [Clarity, Spec §FR-004] → ✅ Addressed in data-model.md Entity 7 (Pattern Mapping table)
- [x] CHK010 - Is the NOT_IMPLEMENTED placeholder format and exit code specified? [Ambiguity, Spec §FR-005] → ✅ Resolved in research.md Decision 4 (exit 1, JSON error message)
- [x] CHK011 - Is the feature-rooted directory structure format precisely defined (e.g., user-story-1 vs user_story_1)? [Clarity, Clarification §2025-10-18] → ✅ Resolved in research.md Decision 3 (user-story-NN format)

## Pattern Mapping Requirements

- [x] CHK012 - Are requirements defined for mapping acceptance criteria verbs to input.json structure? [Gap] → ✅ Addressed in contracts/tc-kit-specify.md Algorithm section
- [x] CHK013 - Are pattern selection heuristics specified (when to use `<uuid>` vs `<string>` vs exact values)? [Gap, Spec §FR-004] → ✅ Resolved in research.md Decision 2 (keyword-based heuristics)
- [x] CHK014 - Are requirements defined for nested pattern matching in complex JSON structures? [Coverage, Spec §FR-004] → ✅ Addressed in data-model.md Entity 7 (works in nested objects, arrays)
- [x] CHK015 - Is the interaction between tc's existing patterns and tc-kit generation logic documented? [Dependency, Spec §FR-025] → ✅ Addressed in contracts/tc-kit-specify.md Dependencies section

## Edge Case Coverage

- [x] CHK016 - Are requirements defined for handling specs with no user stories? [Edge Case, Gap] → ✅ Resolved in research.md Decision 7 (generate empty traceability, warn)
- [x] CHK017 - Are requirements defined for malformed acceptance criteria (missing Given/When/Then)? [Exception Flow, Gap] → ✅ Resolved in research.md Decision 7 (skip scenario, log warning)
- [x] CHK018 - Are requirements specified for duplicate scenario names within a user story? [Edge Case, Gap] → ✅ Resolved in research.md Decision 7 (append -variant-N suffix)
- [x] CHK019 - Are requirements defined for acceptance criteria that reference non-JSON outputs (UI, files)? [Edge Case, Spec §Edge Cases] → ✅ Addressed in spec.md Edge Cases (generate placeholder with TODO)

## Scenario Coverage

- [x] CHK020 - Are requirements defined for the primary generation flow (happy path)? [Coverage, Spec §US-1.AC-1] → ✅ Addressed in contracts/tc-kit-specify.md Algorithm section
- [x] CHK021 - Are requirements specified for regeneration scenarios (rm -rf tests && regenerate)? [Coverage, Clarification §2025-10-18] → ✅ Addressed in Clarifications (rm -rf tests safe, specs are source of truth)
- [x] CHK022 - Are requirements defined for partial generation failures (some scenarios succeed, others fail)? [Exception Flow, Gap] → ✅ Resolved in research.md Decision 7 (exit 2, partial success)

## Measurability & Acceptance

- [x] CHK023 - Can "tc-compatible test suites" be objectively verified against tc framework requirements? [Measurability, Spec §FR-001] → ✅ Yes, via tc test execution and contracts/tc-kit-specify.md Testing Contract
- [x] CHK024 - Can the 30-second generation time requirement be measured for varying spec sizes? [Measurability, Spec §SC-001] → ✅ Yes, addressed in plan.md Performance Goals and contracts/tc-kit-specify.md Performance section
- [x] CHK025 - Can the 90% mapping success rate be objectively calculated from test runs? [Measurability, Spec §SC-002] → ✅ Yes, via validation reports from /tc.validate (FR-012)
