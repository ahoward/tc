# Specification Quality Checklist: Test-Kit Integration with Spec-Kit

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-10-18
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Summary

**Status**: âœ… PASSED - All checklist items complete

**Key Strengths**:
- Technology-agnostic throughout - no mention of specific frameworks, languages, or tools beyond required dependencies (tc, jq, bash)
- Success criteria are measurable and user-focused (time, percentages, reduction metrics)
- Clear user stories with priorities and independent testability
- Comprehensive edge cases addressing real-world scenarios
- Well-defined scope with explicit out-of-scope items
- Strong traceability through FR/SC numbering

**Notes**:
- Specification is ready for `/speckit.clarify` or `/speckit.plan`
- No clarifications needed - all requirements are unambiguous
- User stories are independently testable with clear acceptance scenarios
- Success criteria focus on user/team outcomes rather than technical metrics
