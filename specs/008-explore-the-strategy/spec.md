# Feature Specification: Test-Kit Integration with Spec-Kit

**Feature Branch**: `008-explore-the-strategy`
**Created**: 2025-10-18
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "explore the strategy taken by github's spec-kit. strategize a way to leverage 'tc' such that in could integrate, perhaps through a fork of 'spec-kit' called 'tc-kit', that would imply a system of /slash commands, that would assist having a test suite that was 'as high level' as 'spec-kit'. by this, we mean 'how can we write lang/tech/framework/etc agnostic tests, that can be coupled with spec-kit (install spec-kit + tc-kit) such that the development process can 'drill down' to implementation details, without needing to introduce lang/framework specfici tests 'too early''. by this, we mean while exploration is continuing but also while a testing harness is needed, to refine concepts, specs, and code."

## Executive Summary

Create a tc-kit companion to GitHub's spec-kit that leverages tc's language-agnostic testing capabilities to support specification-driven development. Test-kit enables teams to define and execute technology-agnostic acceptance tests that remain stable during exploration phases while allowing gradual refinement toward implementation-specific tests as the project matures.

**Core Value**: Bridge the gap between high-level behavioral specifications and concrete implementation by providing a testing harness that evolves with the development process, from concept validation to production-ready code.

## Clarifications

### Session 2025-10-18

- Q: What are the expected scale limits for tc-kit to handle effectively? → A: No hard limits, graceful degradation with performance warnings beyond 50 stories
- Q: What specific criteria should trigger transitions between test maturity levels (concept → exploration → implementation)? → A: Hybrid suggestion-based approach - system detects signals (first implementation commit, test stability patterns, decision markers in spec) and suggests transitions, but teams explicitly control transitions via command flags
- Q: How should tc-kit persist and maintain traceability links between spec requirements and test scenarios? → A: Store all spec-kit state/info inside ./tc/spec-kit/ directory (e.g., ./tc/spec-kit/traceability.json), enabling teams to rm -rf tests and regenerate from specs as the source of truth
- Q: What format should `/tc.validate` use for validation reports? → A: Dual output - rich terminal markdown for TTY sessions, JSON file for non-TTY/CI (matching tc's existing TTY detection), always persist ./tc/spec-kit/validation-report.json for auditing
- Q: How should `/tc.specify` organize generated test suites in the directory structure? → A: Feature-rooted structure mirroring spec directories - ./tc/tests/{feature-name}/user-story-{n}/scenario-{n}/ - maintaining consistency with spec-kit conventions and supporting clean regeneration

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - Spec-First Test Creation (Priority: P1)

A product team defines feature requirements in spec-kit markdown and immediately generates technology-agnostic acceptance tests that validate behavior without committing to implementation details.

**Why this priority**: This is the foundation - teams need to validate understanding of requirements through executable tests before writing any code. Without this, spec-driven development cannot proceed.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by creating a spec document, running `/tc.specify` command, and verifying that technology-agnostic test suites are generated in tc format that pass/fail based on expected.json validation.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a spec-kit specification with user stories and acceptance criteria, **When** developer runs `/tc.specify`, **Then** tc test suites are generated with input/expected JSON pairs matching each acceptance scenario
2. **Given** generated test suites without implementation, **When** tests are executed, **Then** all tests fail with clear "NOT_IMPLEMENTED" messages
3. **Given** multiple acceptance scenarios in one user story, **When** test generation occurs, **Then** each scenario becomes a separate tc test case in the same suite

---

### User Story 2 - Progressive Test Refinement (Priority: P2)

As development progresses from exploration to implementation, teams incrementally refine abstract tests into technology-specific assertions without losing the original behavioral intent.

**Why this priority**: Supports the "drill down" requirement - teams explore solutions with abstract tests early, then refine them as decisions solidify. This enables iterative development while maintaining test coverage.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by taking an existing abstract test suite, running `/tc.refine` with increasing specificity levels, and verifying tests evolve from pure JSON patterns to implementation-aware validations while maintaining backward compatibility.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** technology-agnostic tests using pattern matching (`<uuid>`, `<timestamp>`), **When** team decides on specific implementations, **Then** `/tc.refine` offers options to add technology-specific assertions while preserving original patterns
2. **Given** test suites at "concept" maturity level, **When** development reaches "implementation" phase, **Then** refinement command suggests converting abstract patterns to concrete validations based on actual code
3. **Given** refined tests with implementation details, **When** original spec changes, **Then** tc-kit detects conflicts between abstract spec requirements and concrete test assertions

---

### User Story 3 - Cross-Phase Test Validation (Priority: P3)

Teams validate that implementation-specific tests still satisfy original specification requirements, catching regressions where code meets new tests but violates original intent.

**Why this priority**: Essential quality gate but depends on stories 1 and 2 being complete. Prevents the common problem where refactored tests pass but no longer validate the original spec.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by creating abstract tests from specs, refining them with implementation details, then running `/tc.validate` to receive reports showing spec-to-test traceability and highlighting divergence.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** original spec-derived tests and refined implementation tests, **When** running `/tc.validate`, **Then** report shows which spec requirements are covered by which test cases with traceability matrix
2. **Given** implementation tests that pass but refined tests that changed behavior, **When** validation runs, **Then** warnings indicate potential spec violations with side-by-side comparison
3. **Given** new implementation features not in original spec, **When** validation runs, **Then** report flags untested spec requirements and out-of-scope implementations

---

### Edge Cases

- What happens when a spec defines acceptance criteria that cannot be tested with JSON input/output (e.g., UI interactions, real-time streams)? System should flag these scenarios and suggest alternative test approaches (visual regression, streaming test patterns).
- How does system handle specs with ambiguous acceptance criteria that could map to multiple test interpretations? Test generation should create multiple test variants with clear labels indicating different interpretations.
- What happens when implementation technology changes (e.g., Ruby to Go) during development? Tests should remain stable since they're technology-agnostic at the spec level, with only runner implementations needing updates.
- How does tc-kit handle specs that define timing/performance requirements? Pattern matching should support `<duration>` with configurable thresholds, and validation warnings when actual timings exceed spec limits.
- What happens when team refines tests to be too implementation-specific and loses spec alignment? Validation command should detect this drift and warn about over-specification.

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements

**Test Generation from Specs**:

- **FR-001**: System MUST generate tc-compatible test suites directly from spec-kit specification documents
- **FR-002**: System MUST create one test scenario per acceptance criteria defined in spec user stories
- **FR-003**: System MUST generate input.json and expected.json files using tc's pattern matching syntax for abstract requirements
- **FR-004**: Generated tests MUST use technology-agnostic patterns (`<uuid>`, `<timestamp>`, `<string>`, `<number>`, etc.) by default

## Assumptions

1. **Spec-Kit Adoption**: Teams are using or willing to adopt spec-kit for specification-driven development
2. **JSON-Testable Behaviors**: Most acceptance criteria can be validated through JSON input/output patterns (APIs, CLIs, data processing)
3. **Test-First Discipline**: Teams commit to writing/generating tests from specs before implementation code
4. **TC Framework Stability**: Existing tc pattern matching and test execution capabilities are sufficient for spec validation
5. **Markdown-Based Specs**: Specifications follow spec-kit's markdown format with structured acceptance criteria
6. **Incremental Refinement**: Teams prefer progressive test evolution over big-bang rewrites as understanding deepens
7. **Traceability Value**: Teams value knowing which tests validate which spec requirements for compliance/auditing
8. **AI Agent Integration**: Development workflow includes AI coding assistants (Copilot, Claude, etc.) that can execute slash commands
9. **Directory Structure**: Test-kit can store test suites in feature-specific directories alongside spec artifacts
10. **Pattern Extensibility**: TC_CUSTOM_PATTERNS configuration is sufficient for domain-specific abstractions without tc modification

## Dependencies

- **TC Framework**: Test-kit relies on tc's pattern matching, test execution, and reporting capabilities
- **Spec-Kit (Optional)**: While designed to complement spec-kit, tc-kit can function independently with any markdown spec format
- **JQ**: Required for JSON manipulation in test generation and validation scripts
- **Bash 4.0+**: Shell scripting environment for tc-kit slash command implementations
- **Git**: Version control for tracking test evolution and spec-to-test mappings across branches

## Out of Scope

- Modifying spec-kit codebase (tc-kit is standalone companion)
- UI/visual testing (focus on behavior validation through JSON)
- Performance/load testing beyond basic timing validation
- Test data generation beyond simple JSON fixtures
- Continuous integration configuration (teams handle CI integration)
- Database schema testing (out of tc's JSON-based testing model)
- Real-time streaming/websocket testing (future enhancement)
- Multi-service orchestration testing (focus on single-service boundaries)
- Security/penetration testing (different testing domain)
- Backward compatibility with pre-pattern-matching tc versions

## Notes

**Why This Matters**: GitHub spec-kit provides excellent specification-driven development workflow but lacks a testing companion that matches its philosophy. Teams often fall back to implementation-specific tests too early, breaking the language-agnostic promise of spec-driven development.

**TC's Unique Fit**: TC's pattern matching, language-agnostic test runner contract, and JSON-based validation align perfectly with spec-kit's technology-agnostic specifications. The same test suite validates Ruby, Go, Python, or Rust implementations without modification.

**Progressive Disclosure**: The maturity level system (concept→exploration→implementation) acknowledges that teams need different levels of test specificity at different development phases. Early exploration benefits from abstract pattern validation; production-ready code needs concrete assertions.

**Spec-Code Co-Evolution**: Test-kit's traceability and validation features address the common problem where specs and code drift apart over time. Automated detection of spec-test divergence keeps documentation and implementation aligned.

**Slash Command Philosophy**: Mirroring spec-kit's `/speckit.*` commands with `/tc.*` variants maintains cognitive consistency for developers already using spec-driven workflows.
